### *Prime Care for the Ai Era*

Holosense is a medical AI and sensing technology company developing non-invasive, AI-native, multimodal devices designed to fundamentally reshape how humans interact with their health data.

We believe health should be ambient, continuous, and personalised, not fragmented, reactive, or one-size-fits-all. With a full-stack platform combining proprietary biophotonic sensors, advanced biodata acquisition, and real-time AI analytics, we’re enabling a future where diagnostics happen before symptoms, where insight is proactive, and where care is distributed, at home, on the go, and at the edge.

### *Our Mission and Vision*

We’re building a future where every person has continuous access to deep physiological insights, without friction, invasiveness, or dependence on centralised systems.

Our mission is to democratise precision health through intelligent sensing and adaptive AI, making the tools for prevention, optimisation, and early diagnosis available to all.

We imagine a world where the human body is no longer a black box but an active, intelligent information system accessible through digital twin technology.

### *The State of AI*

AI has advanced rapidly across domains like language and vision, now evolving to become agentic and soon generalised.

AI isn’t Moore’s Law, but it rhymes with it providing us a window of opportunities within its exponential trajectory in model capabilities, efficiency, accuracy and reach.

Often compared to electricity, AI's impact spans horizontally and vertically across numerous domains within our society, economy, and industry.

We view medicine and biodata as the most promising fields for creating meaningful impact and enabling breakthrough discoveries.

We believe the true bottleneck in AI development isn’t model performance, but the quality and richness of data, especially real-time, contextual signals that reflect the dynamic nature of the world.

Medical AI, specifically, is often trained on episodic and incomplete data. Instead, we're focused on **biodata**: real-time, high-frequency, medical-grade signals that reflect the true state of the body across time and context.

To make this data useful, we're building the infrastructure for the **Human Digital Twin OS**: a continuously updating, personalised model of the body that empowers humans and clinicians alike to act earlier, faster, and smarter.

### *Who We Are*

We are a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers and designers. We’ve built embedded systems, shipped hardware product, published on AI, and designed experiences used by millions.

We believe access to health data should be a universal right, accessible to anyone, anywhere, in real time. We’re building intelligent systems that sense the earliest signs of disruption and empower people to manage chronic conditions with autonomy, insight, and continuity.

### *The Human Digital Twin OS*

At the core of Holosense is a living model of the human body: constantly sensing, updating, and interacting. Our platform integrates multiple physiological signals: optical, electrical, molecular, behavioural and environmental, into a unified biodata layer.

This allows our AI to model both acute states and long-term trends, opening new frontiers in early detection, remote diagnostics, and continuous optimisation.

### *Our Foundations: Hardware, Reimagine*d

We’ve developed proprietary biophotonic sensors and multimodal hardware to measure biomarkers that traditional wearables can’t. Our non-intrusive devices extract rich, clinically relevant signals without needles, labs, or bulky equipment.

We’re not just capturing data, we’re raising the resolution of human health.

### *An Ethical Framework, By Design*

The implementation of biodata analytics necessitates a robust ethical architecture framework. Holosense adheres to the following data governance principles:

- **Data Sovereignty:** User-controlled data ownership with immutable access controls.
- **Explicit Consent Framework:** Granular, revocable permissions with cryptographically signed audit trails.
- **Algorithmic Transparency:** Explainable AI methodologies with accessible model documentation.
- **Purpose Limitation Protocol:** Strict data processing boundaries defined by containerized execution environments.
- **Privacy-by-Default Architecture:** Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption for sensitive operations.
- **Accountability Infrastructure:** Automated compliance verification through continuous integration testing.

Ethics represents a fundamental technical requirement in our system architecture, not merely a regulatory consideration.

### *Learning by Doing*

We believe in fast cycles of real-world iteration. Lab tests are critical, but they’re not enough. We build and test our devices with patients, physicians, and users across diverse environments: in hospitals, in homes, in motion.

This co-design approach ensures we don’t just build *for* people, we build *with* them.

### *Join Us*

We’re building a new category of health infrastructure platform, and we’re looking for collaborators across three key domains:

**→ Product**

Design end-to-end experiences that make biodata actionable. From signal to screen, you’ll define how people interact with their digital twin. Ideal for builders who love both complexity and clarity.

**→ Core Infrastructure**

Help us architect and scale the backbone for biodata capture, synchronization, and analysis. You’ll work on distributed systems, edge computing, privacy-first protocols, and cross-device synchronization.

**→ Machine Learning**

Work on foundational models for biosignal analysis, anomaly detection, longitudinal modeling, and multimodal fusion. We’re hiring both pragmatic modelers and researchers who can bridge signal processing with deep learning.

**→ Hardware & Embedded Systems**

Develop the physical intelligence layer of our platform. From sensor design and electronics prototyping to embedded firmware and real-time signal processing, you’ll help bring our devices to life, fast, accurate, and built for the edge.

**→ Product Engineering & Manufacturing**

Bridge physics, design, and scalability. You’ll work on industrial design, rapid prototyping, precision engineering, and scalable manufacturing processes, turning breakthrough hardware into beautiful, reliable, and manufacturable products.

### *Open Source. Open Science.*

We’re committed to contributing to the broader scientific community. Key components of our platform, sensor interfaces, datasets, visualisation tools, will be open-sourced over time.

We believe that open ecosystems yield better science, faster progress, and more equitable outcomes.

\**Holosense is not a gadget company. It’s a bet on the body as the next frontier for computing, intelligence, and agency. If that excites you, join us.*\
